    "You can learn Git on the command line or using a GUI.  Knowing the command line basics is useful if you are ever using it remotely (on a server for example).  Usually, using a GUI is the best idea for a beginner. One reason is that Git is quite complicated and it is easy to get yourself into a bit of a mess.\n",

    "(Personal Opinion: Another DVC system - [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org) - is much better than Git as it is more restricted in what you can do and has a more logical 'model' of changes. However, Git is now dominating the DVCS space so it makes sense to use it to be compatible with the developer community.)\n"
